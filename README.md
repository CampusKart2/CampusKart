## Overview

### What is CampusKart?

**CampusKart** is a campus-only marketplace where college students buy and sell textbooks, furniture, electronics, clothing, and dorm essentials within a verified .edu community. Every user is tied to a real university, and exchanges are designed to happen on or near campus—combining the convenience of a marketplace with the trust of a closed, verified network.

### Why We Built It

| Problem | Our Solution |
|--------|---------------|
| Generic marketplaces feel risky for students | **Campus-verified users** — only .edu emails |
| Listings scattered across Craigslist, Facebook, flyers | **One place** for all campus buying & selling |
| No trust signals for student-to-student deals | **Reviews, ratings, condition badges**, safety guidelines |
| Poor mobile experience for quick dorm deals | **Mobile-first** design, fast search, filters, and chat |

We built CampusKart as a **Senior Software Engineering / university course project** to deliver a production-quality MVP: modern frontend practices, clear architecture, and a defined path to backend and deployment.

### Key Differentiators

- **.edu verification** — Access limited to current students and staff
- **Campus-scoped** — Listings and meetups designed for your school
- **Trust-first** — Reviews, condition labels, safety tips, and report flows
- **Student-centric UX** — Price filters (e.g. “Under $20”, “Free”), Deal of the Day, wishlist, recently viewed

### Target Audience

- **College and university students** buying or selling course materials, dorm items, and electronics
- **Campus organizations** and **administrations** interested in a sanctioned, safe marketplace

## Architecture

### High-Level Model

- **Client–server** — React SPA talks to a REST API (planned). Real-time chat over WebSockets (Socket.io).
- **RESTful API** — Express.js: listings, users, auth, conversations. REST for CRUD; WebSockets for chat.
- **Real-time layer** — Socket.io for live messaging and presence (Sprint 1).
- **Database** — PostgreSQL with Prisma. Core entities: Users, Listings, Categories, Conversations, Messages, Reviews.
- **Authentication** — Register/Login → JWT. .edu verification → email code → mark user verified. Frontend stores token; backend validates on protected routes.

### Current Frontend Architecture

- **Single mock source** — One `mockListings.ts` (and related) for consistent IDs and shape across Browse, Category, Detail, Similar, Deal of the Day.
- **Context** — Bookmarks and Chat state in React Context; theme in a hook + `localStorage`.
- **Routing** — Hash-based; one `App.tsx` switch for all routes.
